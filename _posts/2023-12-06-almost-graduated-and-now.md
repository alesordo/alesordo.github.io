I don't know why I'm writing in here, as nobody will probably ever see this content. Possibly it could be because of that. Nevertheless, I'm almost done with my master's, on the next 20th December everything will be over, adios, goodbye.

From a guy who liked computers all his life, but pursued classical ancient studies in high school to a computer engineer (or computer science engineer, or whatever) it was a long, tortuous path. But still, I did it and the best has yet to come. 

The problem is that now, with only my dissertation to prepare, I'm starting to think about jobs. Not that I didn't before, but now the moment is coming and I need to find one. Even though I'm receiving a bunch of offers from all over Italy, because there is a high demand of people with my degree, I haven't found a good match for my needs and I would like to start my career abroad.

I previously got an offer from Ireland :ireland:, where I did my thesis internship, of which I'm thinking about a lot, since it will last just one year and seems interesting. The thing is that it is in a research centre and I don't have the perspective of going into academia, but rather would like to work in industry. So, I don't know how good it will be for my career. Moreover, Ireland is poorly connected compared to the rest of Europe (it's an island bruh).

Of course I don't want to be too picky, not having any major experience so far, so I'll need to start somewhere. The ideal situation though, would be to find a workplace in countries I've already selected as my potential goals, like Germany, Switzerland.

The market there is good, but not speaking german and not having any previous experience doesn't help. But I'll do my best and try to learn german.

It's hard nowadays, you don't have a lot of guidance in this mad world of IT jobs, where everyone seems to want you, but you never know what to expect or you like other companies better. It's like when you have a big crush on someone who ignores you, but another person you like a bit less is flirting. Maybe you go with that second person and become the happiest person on earth. Or maybe you live an hell on earth. The same could be said for the crush, though.

So you never know what to expect, but at least try, that's my philosophy.

I just wish italian universities start to actually change their system because, even if the learning quality is high, you get almost no hands-on experience. For example, summer internships were completely unknown, at least in my uni. When I discovered them, almost a year ago, I was shocked and angry because I didn't have the opportunity to try this experience.

Whatever, everything will go as it needs to, as long as I work hard. For the moment let's just chill a bit, prepare my presentation and start to dive deep into data structures and algorithms :wink:.
